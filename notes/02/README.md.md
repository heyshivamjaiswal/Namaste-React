### What is `NPM`?

`NPM` (Node Package Manager) is a tool used to manage and install packages for Node.js projects.

It comes with Node.js and provides a CLI to interact with the **NPM Registry**, which hosts public and private packages.

- **Initialize NPM project:**
    
    ```bash
    npm init
    
    ```
    
    Use `npm init -y` to skip manual setup and auto-generate `package.json`.
    
- **Alternative:** `yarn`

### ⚙️ What is `Parcel/Webpack`? Why do we need it?

They are **web application bundlers** used to manage, bundle, and optimize code for development and production.

**Why we use them:**

- To bundle and optimize multiple files into a single output.
- To enable advanced features like HMR, minification, caching, etc.
- To simplify development and ensure compatibility across browsers.

### 🔥 Parcel Features:

- **HMR (Hot Module Replacement)** – updates modules in real-time without reloading the page.
- **File watcher algorithm (C++)** – detects file changes efficiently.
- **Minification & Optimization** – reduces file size and improves performance.
- **Development & Production Builds**
- **Caching for faster rebuilds**
- **Zero Configuration** – works out of the box.

### Installation & Commands:

```bash
npm install -D parcel
npx parcel <entry_point>        # development build
npx parcel build <entry_point>  # production build

```

---

### 📦 What is `.parcel-cache`?

`.parcel-cache` stores build information to speed up rebuilds. It helps Parcel skip redundant re-analysis during development.

---

### ⚡ What is `npx`?

`npx` is a package runner (comes with npm ≥ 5.2). It allows executing packages directly from the npm registry **without global installation**.

---

### 📚 Dependencies vs DevDependencies

- **Dependencies:** Required for the app to run (e.g., React, Express).
- **DevDependencies:** Needed only during development (e.g., Parcel, Vite).

Install examples:

```bash
npm install --save        # normal dependency
npm install --save-dev    # dev dependency

```

---

### 🌲 What is `Tree Shaking`?

A technique used to **remove unused (dead) code** from the final bundle, improving efficiency and reducing file size.

---

### ♻️ What is `Hot Module Replacement (HMR)`?

Allows modules to be updated live without refreshing the whole page — retaining app state and speeding up development.

---

### 🚀 5 Superpowers of Parcel (Top 3 explained)

1. **HMR (Hot Module Replacement)** – Live updates without page reload.
2. **Minification** – Reduces code size for better performance.
3. **Caching** – Speeds up rebuild time by storing previous build data.
4. File watcher algorithm
5. Image optimization

### 🧾 What is `.gitignore`?

Specifies files and folders Git should **ignore** (not track).

Usually includes:

```
node_modules
.env
.DS_Store
*.log

```

Don’t ignore `package-lock.json` as it ensures consistent dependency versions.

---

### 📁 `package.json` vs `package-lock.json`

| Feature | package.json | package-lock.json |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Purpose | Defines project metadata and dependencies | Locks exact dependency versions |
| Created by | Manually or via `npm init` | Automatically generated during install |
| Editable | Yes | No (auto-managed) |
| Importance | Describes dependencies | Ensures reproducible builds |

**Version prefixes:**

- `~1.2.3` → updates only **patch** versions
- `^1.2.3` → updates **minor + patch** versions

---

### ❌ Why not modify `package-lock.json`?

It maintains a snapshot of dependency versions. Modifying or deleting it can cause version mismatches and build errors.

---

### 📦 What is `node_modules`?

A local directory storing all installed dependencies.

It’s **not pushed to GitHub** since it’s large and can be rebuilt using:

```bash
npm install

```

---

### 🏗️ What is the `dist` folder?

The `/dist` folder holds the **production-ready build** — optimized, minified code generated by the bundler for deployment.

---

### 🌐 What is `browserslist`?

A configuration that defines **which browsers your app should support**.

Used by tools like Babel, Autoprefixer, and Parcel to ensure browser compatibility.

---

✅ **Summary**

- NPM manages packages; NPX runs them.
- Parcel is a zero-config bundler with HMR, caching, and minification.
- Always ignore `node_modules`, but keep `package-lock.json`.
- Tree shaking and minification make your bundle efficient.
- `dist` is for production; `.parcel-cache` speeds up builds.
